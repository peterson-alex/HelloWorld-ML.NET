# HelloWorld-ML.NET

**HelloWorld-ML.NET** is an example project that demonstrates how a machine learning model built in [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) might be consumed by another application in the [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) ecosystem using the class library approach. In this example the model is a sentiment analyzer for customer reviews.

`HelloWorld.MLModel` is a class library that was auto-generated by ML.NET's [model builder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/automate-training-with-model-builder) when the model was trained. It was then lightly modified by me (Alex) to make the project easier to share with others and easier to understand. It provides classes and methods that facilitate the use of the machine learning model. `MLModel.zip` represents the model itself. 

`HelloWorld.ConsoleApp` is a console app that references `HelloWorld.MLModel` and serves as an example of how the machine learning model can be consumed by another .NET project.

The machine learning model used in this example is a sentiment analyzer that determines whether a customer review is positive or negative. To analyze different text, change the default text on line 13 of `Program.cs`. 

```C#
var input = new ModelInput()
{
    Text = "This place was awesome!" // text to be analyzed 
};
```
